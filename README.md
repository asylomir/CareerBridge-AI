# CareerBridge: AI-Powered Socio-Technical Matcher

### **Overview**
CareerBridge is a Python-based analysis tool designed to bridge the gap between traditional professional backgrounds (Business/Finance) and emerging roles in **AI for Sustainable Societies**.

### **The Problem**
Many qualified professionals from non-technical backgrounds struggle to identify how their "human-centric" skills translate into the AI labor market. This tool uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to perform semantic matching and identify strategic "bridges" for career transition.

### **Features**
* **Semantic Score:** Calculates a match percentage based on skills and experience.
* **Gap Identification:** Lists the top 3 technical skills needed for the target role.
* **Philosophical Bridge:** Generates a vision for how the candidate can contribute to "Human-Centric AI."

### **Technical Stack**
* **Language:** Python 3
* **API:** OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)
* **Security:** `python-dotenv` for environment variable management.

### **Academic Connection (AISS Portfolio)**
This project was developed as part of my application for the **Erasmus Mundus AI for Sustainable Societies (AISS)** program. It demonstrates my ability to:
1.  Use Python for automated data processing.
2.  Implement secure API connections.
3.  Analyze the socio-economic impact of AI on the future of work.
